## Description

Hi, I’m Ibrahim. I’m a Statistics and Data Science undergraduate at UT Austin (minors in Computer Science and & Risk Management). I’ve worked as a Data Science Intern in the energy industry, building machine learning models, data pipelines, and decision-support tools used by business and operations teams.

My interests are in applied machine learning, LLM-powered applications, and data systems that drive real-world decisions across energy, finance, and consumer products.
